# Custom Logger

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/customlogger.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/customlogger)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SaimonL/CustomLogger.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SaimonL/CustomLogger)

Custom logger allows you to log you're debug information to an html file so you can
view them in much more easier way. All you need to do is include the gem in the
Gemfile and then use it directly CustomLogger.

## Compatable

CustomLogger is compatible with Ruby 1.9 and above. As for Rails 3.x and up.
You should not be using or have Ruby 1.8 installed for obvious reasons.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  [...]
  gem 'customlogger'
  [...]
end
```
Keep in mind that "[...]" means that there may or may not be other gems there.

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install customlogger

## Usage

Custom Logger is very easy to use. Just use the module 'CustomLogger' anywhere
and log the message in a nice friendly colorful html page view. Take a look
at the examples below.

    CustomLogger.error 'This is an error message'
    CustomLogger.error = 'This is an error message'
    CustomLogger.error 'This is an error message', 'Error Title'

#### Log debug

    CustomLogger.debug = 'This is a debug message'
    CustomLogger.debug 'This is a debug message', 'Debug Title'

#### Log info

    CustomLogger.info 'This is an info message'
    CustomLogger.info = 'This is an info message'
    CustomLogger.info 'This is an info message', 'Info Title'

#### Log raw

Keep in mind that raw means that no formatting is applied so if the output
is 1000 characters horizontal without any line break then that is what you
will see. Basically it is inside of a 'pre' html tag.

    CustomLogger.raw 'This is a raw message'
    CustomLogger.raw = 'This is a raw message'
    CustomLogger.raw 'This is a raw message', 'Raw Title'

#### ActiveRecord Support

CustomLogger supports ActiveRecord if you use ActiveRecord. To log ActiveRecord
just use raw logger. For an example:

    CustomLogger.raw User.first, 'This is User.first'

#### New Line

If you want to add a gap in-between sets of outputs then this is what you are
looking for.

    CustomLogger.new_line
