# Custom Logger

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/customlogger.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/customlogger)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SaimonL/CustomLogger.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SaimonL/CustomLogger)

Custom logger allows you to log you're debug infmration to an html file so you can
view them in much more easier way. This is my first gem so expect things not
to be perfect.

## Compatable

CustomLogger is compatable with Ruby 1.9 and above. As for Rails 3.x and up.
You should not be using or have Ruby 1.8 installed for obvious reasons.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development, :test do
  [...]
  gem 'customlogger'
  [...]
end
```
Keep in mind that "[...]" means that there may or may not have other gems there.

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install customlogger

## Usage

Custom Logger is very easy to use. Just use the module 'CustomLogger' anywhere
and log the message in a nice view friendly coloful html page. Take a look
at the examples below.

    CustomLogger.error = 'This is an error message'
    CustomLogger.error 'This is an error message', 'Error Title'

    CustomLogger.debug = 'This is an debug message'
    CustomLogger.debug 'This is an debug message', 'Debug Title'

#### Log info

    CustomLogger.info 'This is an info message'
    CustomLogger.info = 'This is an info message'
    CustomLogger.info 'This is an info message', 'Info Title'

#### Log raw

Keep in mind that raw means that no formatting is applied so if the output
is 1000 characters horizontal without any line break then that is what you
will see. Basically it is inside of a 'pre' html tag.

    CustomLogger.raw 'This is an raw message'
    CustomLogger.raw = 'This is an raw message'
    CustomLogger.raw 'This is an raw message', 'Raw Title'
